We would like to use information about a passenger (gender, age, cabin class) to predict whether they survived the sinking. The general idea is that we will build our own predictor, try it on a passenger to get a guess (survived, perished) and then check our guess against the historical record to see if we were right. The better guesses we make, the more accurate is our predictor."

So we should consider wrangling that column to fill in missing values. What to do about missing values is a really interesting problem. Options we might consider here:\n",

The first 3 are relatively easy to explore. You can compute the mean, median and mode of the Age column once and then try each out in the predictor. The 4th option is worth considering. For instance, perhaps we can guess an age by looking at the corresponding fields of `Sibsp` and `Parch`, which have to do with parents and children. Getting to an actual value will be a journey but might be worth it. We would be giving every passenger with a missing age a value based on their personal attributes, not some global value like mean. The 5th option is also interesting and we will explore it further in coming modules.\n",

The critical question is do the values we fill in for the missing Ages help with overall prediction?
