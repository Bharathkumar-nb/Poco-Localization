    "I will use assessments in each module to test your Python skills. The general idea is that I give you a programming problem to solve. You then type in your answer as code. You hit a submit button, and your code is sent to a special Python listener we have set up. Python runs your code and provides results. We send the results back to you. If you had an error, you can modify your code and resubmit it. We do not limit how many times you submit - goal is to get it right and then move on to next problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems often build on each other, i.e., they need to be taken in order to make sense of them. However, you do not have to actually solve one problem before trying the next. We just encourage it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modules have a \"playground\" notebook where you can practice the concepts in the module. Using the playground notebook is optional but encouraged to help in solving the assessment challenges.\n",

    "This very first assessment will not be on Python - we have not gotten to that module yet. Instead, it will make sure you can use Google docs and specifically Google Sheets to build your own spreadsheet.\n",
