    "Welcome to Hooked on Python: Predicting the Future. In the following modules, I will introduce the Python language through a set of examples that lead us to making predictions from ordinary spreadsheet data. My goal is to provide practical skills that you can use immediately with the data you use in your daily life.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am assuming you do not know how to program. That's ok. Another of my goals is to get you excited about programming in Python (i.e., hooked). My hope is that once you see the powerful things you can do with your own spreadsheets with the basic Python programming you learn in this course, you will be motivated to learn more.\n",

    "As a personal note, the *hooked* approach has worked for me many times when I am the student. I am forever grateful to Earl (the Duke) McKeever for being my first jazz saxophone teacher. At my very first lesson, Earl sized me up as someone who was not going to be motivated by practicing Mary Had a Little Lamb. Instead, Earl gave me some licks from My Little Suede Shoes (https://youtu.be/-JKDFD1PZ8Y) to take home and practice. That hooked me. Now I am playing at the mall! That's me on the left.\n",

For those of you who did not see the movie, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden vorage in 1912. Historians have collected lots of data about the passengers onboard and specifically who survived and who went down with the ship. They have put that data in a spreadsheet.\n",

Gender, ethnicity, and class cerainly played a role in who lived and who died. It also is a good representation of spreadsheet data for this course. It has a variety of columns. It has missing values. It should not look that much different than the type of spreadsheets you use at the office, as part of your hobbies, for keeping data on the youth sports team you coach.\n",
